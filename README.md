# CITS4406 - Assignment 2
Provide a Python file to perform basic cleansing and statistical analysis on data provided via a csv file. Ideally structure the project so that other students can easily pick up/extend the functionality at a later date.

### Running the program
* The program requires Python3, the scipy module, numpy module, alabaster module and pandas 
* module to run, it is recommended that you install these via the python distribution "Anaconda"
* found here: http://continuum.io/downloads
* 

### Data types
* Int
* Float
* Enumerated
* String
* Email
* Currency
* Boolean
* Scientific notation


### Cleansing
* Inconsistent row lengths
* Inconsistent types within columns
    * '-', dash character instead of ''
* Blank values

### Desired analysis
* Numerical
    * Minimum
    * First Quartile
    * Median
    * Mean
    * Third Quartile
    * Maximum
    * Mode
* Top 5 occurring results

You can run the project by extracting the zip, and running 'python3 application.py *csv filename here*'.
